## Installation

To install the Chartr Android App (for development or deployment), follow these steps:
1. Install `Android Studio` and the `Java Development Kit` on your system
3. Clone the Chartr Android repository with git
4. Build the project through Android Studio or by running `./gradlew build` in the Chartr Android directory

The rest of the process of working on the Chartr App is similar to any other Android app. You can run the app on an emulator through Android Studio, and run the unit tests by either running the build as described above, or clicking on the "test" package and selecting "Run All" in the Android Studio menu.
